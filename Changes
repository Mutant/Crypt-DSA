Revision history for Crypt::DSA

0.11
    - Added Crypt::DSA::Key::SSH2, which reads SSH2-format DSA
      key files. These are a different format than those used
      by OpenSSH (that uses PEM-encoded files). Currently only
      reading SSH2 key files is supported, and the files must not
      be encrypted.
    - Added size method to Crypt::DSA::Key. $key->size is number
      of bits in p.

0.10  2001.04.22
    - Added much better test suite: tests bigint utilities in Util,
      sign/verify, key generation (512, 768, 1024 bits), PEM
      encoding/decoding (if Convert::PEM is installed), FIPS 186-2
      example case.
    - Added interface to Convert::PEM to read/write encrypted
      PEM files containing ASN.1-encoded DSA keys. Convert::PEM
      is optional; Makefile.PL will check for it and warn if it
      can't be found.
    - Get/set accessors now take hex values and store their values
      internally as strings. Thanks to Crypt::RSA for the idea. :)

0.03  2001.04.07
    - abstracted signature object into Crypt::DSA::Signature object.

0.02  2001.03.23
    - split up code into separate modules (ie. KeyChain, Key, Util, etc.)
    - switched from using GMP to Pari
    - streamlined code
    - added documentation

0.01  2001.03.22
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.19
